  <h1>General Explain</h1>
  <p>
    I have created a captivating game world using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.
    In this game, I have implemented a class called "World" to manage and render
    various game objects on the canvas. The canvas, in simple terms, is an HTML
    element that allows me to draw graphics using JavaScript.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside the "World" class, I handle all the game logic. This includes
    updating object positions, checking for collisions, and providing a
    delightful gaming experience. You will find an array of exciting elements in
    the game world, such as a character, enemies, coins, waterbombs, and even a
    challenging end boss. You can control the character's movements using your
    keyboard, making it even more interactive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout the game, you can collect coins and waterbombs, and the system
    keeps track of your progress. To enhance your gaming experience, I have
    added sound effects for different events. The "draw()" method is responsible
    for continuously rendering the game objects on the canvas. It ensures that
    their positions are updated and various conditions are checked to keep the
    game running smoothly.
  </p>

  <p>
    By exploring this code, you can witness the fundamentals of game
    development, including object-oriented programming principles, collision
    detection, and engaging game mechanics like collecting objects and defeating
    enemies. The canvas element provides an ideal platform to create visually
    appealing and interactive 2D games or animations directly in your web
    browser. So, get ready for an immersive gaming experience right here on this

  <h2>&lt;canvas&gt;</h2>
  <p>
    The &lt;canvas&gt; tag is an HTML5 element that provides a drawing surface
    within an HTML document. It allows you to dynamically render and manipulate
    graphics, animations, and images using JavaScript. The &lt;canvas&gt;
    element is a rectangular area where you can draw and create visual content.
  </p>

  <p>Here are some key points about the &lt;canvas&gt; tag:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Drawing Context:</strong> The &lt;canvas&gt; element provides a 2D
      drawing context and, with the introduction of HTML5, also a 3D drawing
      context through WebGL. The 2D drawing context allows you to draw shapes,
      lines, text, and images on the canvas using various JavaScript functions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Coordinates and Size:</strong> The &lt;canvas&gt; element has a
      default size of 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high, but you can set its
      width and height attributes to change its dimensions. It uses a coordinate
      system where the top-left corner is (0,0), and the x-axis increases to the
      right, while the y-axis increases downward.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>JavaScript API:</strong> To draw on the canvas, you need to use
      JavaScript and its Canvas API. The Canvas API provides a set of methods
      and properties that allow you to control the drawing operations, such as
      creating paths, setting colors, applying transformations, and rendering
      images.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dynamic and Animated Content:</strong> The &lt;canvas&gt; tag is
      particularly useful for creating dynamic and interactive content. You can
      update the canvas content dynamically based on user input, animation
      loops, or data changes. This makes it a powerful tool for building games,
      data visualizations, graphs, and other interactive applications.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fallback Content:</strong> It's important to note that the
      &lt;canvas&gt; tag requires browser support for HTML5 and JavaScript. If a
      browser doesn't support the &lt;canvas&gt; element, any fallback content
      that you include between the opening and closing tags will be displayed
      instead. This allows you to provide alternative content or instructions
      for browsers that don't support the canvas functionality.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Overall, the &lt;canvas&gt; tag is a versatile element that enables you to
    create and manipulate visual content directly within an HTML document using
    JavaScript. It has opened up new possibilities for interactive and dynamic
    graphics on the web.

  <h1>Functions</h1>
  <h2>Walking</h2>
  <div class="functionEx">
    <img src="assets/gif/character_walking.gif" alt="" />
    <p>
      The character is capable of movement by pressing the designated right key,
      enabling a walking animation. The requisite function to initiate this
      motion is conveniently provided below this section.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="underEx">
    <h3>What happens when you press right</h3>
    <p>game.js</p>
    <p>Please set the debugger on the keyboard.RIGHT line</p>
    <img src="assets/funcitonEx/1. addEventListener.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      It will display "RIGHT: true." The previous value was false due to the
      keyboard class.
